# Simple comparison of regularization methods

This repository contains a simple experiment comparing three selected regularization methods (batchnorm, weightnorm, fast dropout) using a small MLP on CIFAR-100 dataset.

Requires python 2.7, tensorflow, and Keras.

- To run the script, execute `run_experiments.py` from a shell.

- To generate the plots with results, execute `generate_report.py` from a shell.
