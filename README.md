# Simple comparison of regularization methods

This repository contains a simple experiment comparing three selected regularization methods (batchnorm, weightnorm, fast dropout) using a small MLP on CIFAR-100 dataset.

Requires python 2.7, tensorflow, and Keras.

To run the script, execute run_experiments from a shell.
